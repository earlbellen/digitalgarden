## Welcome to My Public Notes

This space is a collection of my personal notes, made public—a concept known as **public learning**. I'm sharing my thoughts, insights, and unfinished ideas not because they're perfect, but because learning in public helps me think more clearly, get feedback, and track how my understanding grows over time.

### What is Public Learning?

Public learning is the practice of sharing what you're learning, as you're learning it. It turns note-taking into a conversation with the wider world. By writing things down and making them visible, I clarify my thinking and invite others to engage, correct, or contribute.

### My Note-Taking Method: Zettelkasten

I use the **Zettelkasten** method, a system that encourages connecting ideas through small, atomic notes. Each note captures a single concept, which I can then link to others across topics. This network of notes helps me build deep understanding over time—not just collect information.

### Why This Approach?

This public notes (aka digital garden) helps me see which areas I’ve explored deeply and where I still have gaps. It's not a polished blog or a traditional wiki. Think of it more like a growing forest of ideas, with some paths well-trodden and others just starting to form.

Thanks for visiting. Feel free to wander, explore, and if you’d like—reach out to share your thoughts!
